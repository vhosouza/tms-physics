### Session 1

*October 4, 2018*

Attendants: VS, BA, AT, MN, JK.

In the beginning, VS introduced the concept we are aiming to solve, ie. **how to calculate the TMS-induced electric current (field) in the brain**. 

Togehter, we sketched a *[flow chart](session_01/how_to_calculate_E-field_flowchart.pdf)* of the process that leads to the E-field. 

In the end we decided, that for the next session we should familiarize ourselves in the ways in which to get from the B-field (which is given) to the E-field.
